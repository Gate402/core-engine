### Proxy Request to Gateway
# Host header determines the gateway subdomain.
# Assuming gateway with subdomain 'my-api' exists.
# This requires adding '127.0.0.1 my-api.localhost' to /etc/hosts if trying to test locally with subdomains,
# OR we can manually set the Host header as done here.

GET {{proxyBaseUrl}}/some-path
Host: my-api.localhost
# If payment is required, you might need payment headers, but basic proxying should work if free or allowed.

### Proxy Request with Custom Domain
GET {{proxyBaseUrl}}/foo
Host: api.example.com

### Health Check (Direct)
GET {{proxyBaseUrl}}/health
